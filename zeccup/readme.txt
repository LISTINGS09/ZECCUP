ZECCUP - Zeus and Eden Compositions / Building Templates for CUP
ZECCUP is a continuation of the ZEC addon, further expanding pre built military objects such as bunkers, bases and outposts for the CUP Terrain Pack. It is very simple to use, just pick a template and place it down! 

The mod uses CUP objects and requires CUP Terrains to function (either CORE or FULL). Anything placed using ZECCUP will remain after this add-on is either disabled or removed, you will of course always require CUP_Terrain_Core or equivalent.

** How to find the ZECCUP templates in Eden/Zeus ** 
1. Press F2 to select the 'Compositions/Groups' menu. 
2. Click the 'Props/Other' icon (yellow one, far right). 
3. Expand out each Composition group to see the list of compositions. 

Click on the template you want to use and you'll be able to place it in your mission. There are over 100 different compositions to choose from!
